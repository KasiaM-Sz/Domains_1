Within-domain generalization: To test whether children generalize the characters’ behavior from one situation to another within a domain, we conducted a linear mixed-effects analysis with children's fairness/competence ratings as a dependent variable and these fixed effects as predictors: Character (high-quality/low-quality), Source domain (fairness/competence), and Age (in months), as well as their interactions.
Results showed no significant main effect of the source domain (b = 0.05, SE = 0.58, t(348) = 0.09, p = .931), indicating that children’s generalizations did not differ between fairness and competence domains. We found a main effect of Character (b = -4.33, SE = 0.59, t(348) = -7.38, p < .001), qualified by a significant interaction of Character and Age (b = 0.018, SE = 0.0069, t(348) = 2.69, p = .007). As shown in Figure 3, children overall rated high-quality character higher than low-quality one across all ages, but this difference slightly declined with age.
Next, we examined whether children would preferentially choose one character over the other when choosing a partner for a goal-oriented task (depending on the source domain: sharing or problem-solving). Results showed that within the same domain, children showed a reliable preference for the more fair or competent character, respectively (high-quality character), χ²(1, N = 178) = 119.75, p < .001, choosing high-quality character 162 times (91%) and low-quality one 16 times (9%). Logistic regression analyses with age in months and source domain as predictors showed that this was consistent across ages and did not vary by source domain. In summary, this strong preference suggests that within domains, children consistently generalized greater levels of competence and fairness from past behaviors to future behaviors. A logistic regression analysis testing for age effects in within-domain choices confirmed this, revealing no significant effect of age (b = 0.001, SE = 0.015, z = 0.07, p = .942) or source domain (b = -0.79, SE = 0.56, z = -1.41, p = .160), reinforcing that children’s preference for the higher-trait character remained stable regardless of the task context.
Between-domain generalization: To assess whether children generalized traits across domains, we conducted a linear regression analysis including age in months, character identity (high-quality vs. low-quality), and their interaction as predictors of children's ratings in the between-domain condition. Results revealed a significant main effect of age (b = -0.030, SE = 0.0081, t(160.1) = -3.72, p < .001), indicating that younger children were more likely to generalize traits across domains than older children. We also found a significant main effect of character (b = -4.42, SE = 0.71, t(260.5) = -6.21, p < .001), showing that across the sample, children gave higher ratings to the character who was previously described more positively in a different domain. Crucially, this was qualified by a significant interaction between age and character (b = 0.044, SE = 0.0083, t(260.5) = 5.28, p < .001), suggesting that younger children showed stronger between-domain generalization, while older children increasingly differentiated between fairness and competence.
This interaction is illustrated in Figure 3. In early childhood, the character who was initially described as fairer (or more competent) was rated more positively even in a different, unrelated domain. For example, younger children often judged a fair character to also be competent, and vice versa. As children grew older, however, their evaluations became more differentiated: ratings of each character in the unrelated domain converged, suggesting that older children were less likely to assume global positivity across domains. Thus, our findings point to a developmental shift from broad, cross-domain generalization to more selective trait inference.


  
We also tested whether children’s partner choices reflected cross-domain generalization. Younger children were more likely to choose hih-quality partner across the two between-domain trials, whereas older children showed no clear preference, indicating a developmental shift in trait generalization. This pattern was confirmed by a significant negative effect of age in a logistic regression analysis, b = -0.037, SE = 0.0093, z = -4.03, p < .001  (see Figure 4). While children’s preferences in between-domain trials were relatively balanced overall—a high-quality partner was chosen 94 times (55%) and a low-quality partner 84 times (47%), χ²(1, N = N = 178) = 0.56, p = .454—these proportions varied by age. Younger children exhibited a stronger tendency to generalize positive traits across domains, whereas older children were less influenced by an initial characterization in one domain when making their partner choice.


Friend choice: Children consistently preferred the character with greater fairness or competence as their friend. As shown in Figure 5, 64 children (71.9%) chose hig-quality character, while 25 (28.1%) chose low-quality character, χ²(1, N = 89) = 17.09, p < .001. A logistic regression revealed no significant effects of age (b = -0.005, SE = 0.013, z = -0.35, p = .727),or source domain (b = 0.90, SE = 0.49, z = 1.84, p = .066), suggesting that this preference remained stable across conditions.


 
Liking: Children’s liking judgments were influenced more strongly by fairness than competence, and this effect varied with age. In the Fairness condition, younger children showed a clear preference for, the high-quality character (M = 4.57, SD = 0.58), rating him significantly higher than the low-quality character (M = 3.11, SD = 1.04). However, this preference diminished with age, as indicated by a significant interaction between character and age (b = -0.025, SE = 0.010, t = -2.49, p = .014). The overall effect of character in this condition was significant (b = 1.48, SE = 0.17, t(86.7) = 8.63, p < .001). By contrast, in the Competence condition, children rated high-quality individual (M = 3.84, SD = 0.87) and low-quality (M = 3.74, SD = 0.79) similarly, with no significant difference in liking (t(86.7) = 0.52, p = .660). This suggests that fairness played a stronger role in shaping younger children’s preferences, while older children evaluated both characters more similarly.
